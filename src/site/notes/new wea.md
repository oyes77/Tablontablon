how would seniors would be?


> 150 words min


Seniors are a weird topic to predict on, but there are some interesting ideas of how seniors will be in the future, in 1000 years.

Today, a senior is someone who is over 60 years old, elders is another way to call them, they are protected people most of the time, by the state and the culture, I don't think our society will be better regarding seniors in the future
