	how would seniors be?
> 150 words min


Seniors are a singular topic to predict on, but there are some interesting ideas of how seniors will be in the future, in 1000 years.

Today, a senior is someone who is over 60 years old, elders is another way to call them, they are protected people most of the time, by the state and our culture, clarifying that, I don't think our society will be better regarding seniors in the future, not because our culture would be worse, or at least not *just* that, but because humanity's situation will not be better overall. 

In 1000 years, global warming will have already done most of the damage it can do, so, if future's society manages to come back to the state we are in, via restoring life as it was, or developing newer technologies, seniors will lost some benefits, or status in society, in order to prioritize younger people quality of life, and life expectancy, also, there is such a big timespan, that the cultural trends that exist now, like how we treat elders now, will have changed in 1000 years, and all those feelings of respect, and traditionalism will be less important, transformed onto something else, or discarded for the necessities of the future humanity.
