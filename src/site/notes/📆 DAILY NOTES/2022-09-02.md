### Include a Text Message Signature

One of the best ways to craft a¬†[professional text](https://simpletexting.com/professional-text-message-examples/)¬†is to include a signature.

Just like in an email, a text message signature generally tells your contacts who you are, what your job title is, any credentials you have, and the name of your company.¬†

That‚Äôs the usual recipe for a text signature, but there‚Äôs room to be creative. You can include your company‚Äôs slogan, extra contact information for you, or even your business hours.¬†

For a little inspiration, check out these¬†[text signature examples](https://simpletexting.com/text-message-signature-examples/).¬†

### Keep it Short and to the Point

The only really important rule to follow when writing a text message introduction is to keep it focused. This isn‚Äôt the time to chat about the weather„Éºget the point across in as few words as possible.

Consider this example:

_Hi Martha! It‚Äôs Joan Newsom from the Las Vegas Realtor Conference. It was so great to connect„Éºare you still interested in referrals?_

This message includes a polite greeting, the name of the sender, how the two connected, and a direct question that explains why the recipient is getting the text in the first place.

### Include Action Steps

When you send an introduction text, be sure you don‚Äôt just introduce yourself and leave your contact unsure about what to do next.¬†

Include a call to action or question that prompts a response, like, ‚ÄúVisit my calendar and choose a meeting time,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúAre you still available for a consultation?‚Äù¬†

This keeps the interaction moving and gives your contact a clear next step to follow.

### Keep Your Tone Conversational

Even though you‚Äôre sending your text in a business context, there‚Äôs no need to be too formal or stuffy.¬†

Keep your tone friendly and conversational. One of the biggest reasons texting is currently so popular is that it‚Äôs an intimate way to communicate. So, you‚Äôll want to sound like a normal person in your messages.

You can even include¬†[emojis](https://simpletexting.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-emoji-marketing/)¬†for a little variety„Éºthey‚Äôll make you sound even more approachable and personable.

With these tips in mind, we‚Äôll give you a few templates you can use to start writing your own introduction texts.¬†
