After you’ve tapped on the three dots on your profile banner, you’ll be given an option to copy your Discord ID.

**Tap on “Copy ID”** to copy your Discord ID.

A Discord profile link requires a Discord ID.

Hence, you need to copy your ID to get your profile link.

## 4. Modify the “discordapp.com/users/yourID” link

![How to find your Discord profile link](https://i0.wp.com/www.followchain.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/discord-profile-link-4edit.jpg?resize=297%2C512&ssl=1)

After you’ve copied your Discord ID, you need to open a browser.

If you’re using an iPhone, open the Safari web browser.

On the other hand, if you’re using an Android device, open Chrome.

Once you’re on a browser, you need to **copy and paste this link** into the URL field (before):

```
discordapp.com/users/yourID
```

Now, you need to **replace “yourID” with your Discord ID.**

For example, if your ID is “302050872383242240”, you need to replace “yourID” with “302050872383242240” without quotation marks.

Here’s an example of a valid link (after):

```
discordapp.com/users/302050872383242240
```

Essentially, the “discordapp.com/users/yourID” link allows you to visit someone’s profile on Discord.

It’s similar to an Instagram profile link like “instagram.com/followchainorg”.

## 5. Send the link to your friends

After you’ve replaced “yourID” with your Discord ID, copy the link to your clipboard.

You’ve successfully copied your Discord profile link!
