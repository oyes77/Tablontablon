## What’s Up with My Kamvas’ Color Accuracy? It Looks Like Crap Out of the Box!

Windows guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/comments/8n2d7r/reminder_calibrate_your_display/](https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/comments/8n2d7r/reminder_calibrate_your_display/)

The matrix itself is okay, problem is that factory calibration is abysmal out of the box. First calibrate via tablet built in hardware menu (buttons on your tablet). Then go to Nvidia Panel and Under Display > Change Resolution find your tablet, then under “Output dynamic range” select “Full”. Finally go to “Adjust desktop color setting” and start tweaking settings while looking at these 2 pages: [http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/](http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/) [https://www.photofriday.com/info/calibrate](https://www.photofriday.com/info/calibrate) Rinse and repeat with both hardware buttons and nvidia settings until you achieve desirable effect. You will not get it incredibly accurate or to display full blacks while displaying full whites simultaneously, so you will have to compromise. If you are serious about calibration and have cash to spare – buy yourself one of these [https://www.xrite.com/categories/calibration-profiling/colormunki-family](https://www.xrite.com/categories/calibration-profiling/colormunki-family) or one of these [https://spyderx.datacolor.com/](https://spyderx.datacolor.com/)
