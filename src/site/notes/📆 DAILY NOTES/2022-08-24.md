## Admin Role

If you have regular admins and you want them to **only use Wick's moderation commands without having any other advantage**, you can add their admin role to Wick's statics.

> To add an admin role, follow **`w!statics <ROLE> ?add 3`**

**`<ROLE>`** can be:

-   **Mention:** You can just mention the role you want to have as an Admin role
-   **Name:** Just type out the role's name if you want. Wick will catch it.
-   **ID:** This is the most accurate way in case Wick ends up adding another role.


### Adding an Admin Role

**For example:** If you have a role named **Wick-Admin** which has the ID **813468620461047818** and you want to add it as an Admin role, you can do either of the following:

-   `w!statics @Wick-Admin ?add 3`
-   `w!statics Wick-Admin ?add 3`
-   `w!statics 813468620461047818 ?add 3`
-   `w!statics Wick-Ad ?add 3`

### Deleting an Admin Role

**For example:** If you have an Admin role named **Wick-Admin** set in statics and you want to delete it as an Admin role, you can do either of the following:

-   `w!statics @Wick-Admin ?del 1`
-   `w!statics Wick-Admin ?del 1`
-   `w!statics 813468620461047818 ?del 1`
-   `w!statics Wick-Ad ?del 1`

w!s @813468620461047818 ?del 3

You can add up to only **5** admin roles!

You can view the admin roles you have set in Statics by using the command **`w!statics`** or more specifically **`w!statics 3`**.

People with an **admin role set in Wick** have **[LEVEL 3 Wick permit]** in your server!

People with an **admin role set in Wick** can use:

-   Mute Commands
-   Unmute Command
-   Kick Commands
-   Ban Commands
-   Warn Commands
-   View others' info


Admins are still monitored by Wick!!! Admins trying to outsmart Wick and use it's moderation commands to mass kick or ban **will be punished.** **Any action you do with Wick's moderation commands is on you!**

## Moderator Role

If you have Moderators and you want them to **only use Wick's moderation commands without having any other advantage**, you can add their Moderator role to Wick's statics.

> To add a Moderator role, follow **`w!statics <ROLE> ?add 4`**

**`<ROLE>`** can be:

-   **Mention:** You can just mention the role you want to have as a Mod role
-   **Name:** Just type out the role's name if you want. Wick will catch it.
-   **ID:** This is the most accurate way in case Wick ends up adding another role.
