## Should I leave?

- [p] yes
	- Oka is back and messing with my stuff too much, part because Oka just likes to do so, and part because I'm afk these days, so "it's allowed" since i'm not making use of it.
	- I don't have enough time to dedicate to the server.
	- I don't feel passionate about it anymore, might be burnout (?)
	- I feel like compromising to a big project is too much, that's what I used to do in the sv, big things
	- I don't draw anymore, so It would be weird to use it as a platform if i'm not gonna do stuff related to art, ergo, my "Life project" isn't the server anymore.
	- 
- [c] no
	- I work in trillizos currently, stop being owner means I potentially risk that.
	- I haver an emotional attachment to the server and some of it's community.
	- It's a potential platform for myself and my *inexistent rn* content.
	- It's a platform for Lade.
	- I don't have any other real link with Oka besides the server, we are not friends, so that also will make us strangers practically.
	- It would be saying bye to a stage of my life, I suppose.

### What is more helpful for me/us, Â¿being the leader of something or be in multiple places as a participant?

**[[2024-02-24\|2024-02-24]]** - I will take a break of the server for a few weeks at least.
