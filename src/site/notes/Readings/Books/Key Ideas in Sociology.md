> > Key Ideas in Sociology provides a tour d'horizon of the great sociological thinkers of the last two centuries -- their lives, their main ideas, and their influence on further thinking and practice in sociology. Fifty key thinkers in sociology are represented, both to give a sense of history to the development of the discipline and to exemplify the range of issues that have been covered. Each essay concludes with an annotated Suggested Readings list, and a General Bibliography is also provided.
