> > Now available for the first time: all three novels from the amazing Magnus Chase series, collected in one stunning digital edition. My name is Magnus Chase. I'm orphaned and living rough on the streets of Boston. And things are about to get much worse. My day started out normally enough. I was sleeping under a bridge when some guy kicked me awake and said, 'They're after you.' Next thing I know, I'm reunited with my obnoxious uncle, who casually informs me that my long-lost father is a Norse god. And it turns out the gods of Asgard are preparing for war. Apparently, if I can't find the sword my father lost two thousand years ago, there will be doom. Doomsday, to be precise. But first I'm going to die. This is the story of how my life goes downhill from there... Magnus Chase: The Complete Series includes all three novels in the action-packed, electrifying series from Rick Riordan: The Sword of Summer, The Hammer of Thor and The Ship of the Dead
