Daily notes will be for journaling 
For tasks there will be [[tasks dump\|tasks dump]]
Then I can query from there with tags, that’s the user I’ll give to talks.
Also I’ll need a [[dataview queries\|dataview queries]] where I’ll have all My queries under headers to call them on canvas
That means I need to really rework and simplify my daily notes xd
