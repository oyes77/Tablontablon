> > The papers contained in this volume are summaries-in some cases, owing to the defectiveness of the reports, very much abridged summaries-of a series of discourses delivered at the Liberal Summer School at Oxford in the first ten days of August, 1922. In two cases ("The State and Industry" and "The Machinery of Government") two lectures have been condensed into a single paper.
