> > The #1 New York Times bestseller and National Book Award Finalist from the bestselling author of Everything, Everything will have you falling in love with Natasha and Daniel as they fall in love with each other. Natasha: Iâ€™m a girl who believes in science and facts. Not fate. Not destiny. Or dreams that will never come true. Iâ€™m definitely not the kind of girl who meets a cute boy on a crowded New York City street and falls in love with him. Not when my family is twelve hours away from being deported to Jamaica. Falling in love with him wonâ€™t be my story. Daniel: Iâ€™ve always been the good son, the good student, living up to my parentsâ€™ high expectations. Never the poet. Or the dreamer. But when I see her, I forget about all that. Something about Natasha makes me think that fate has something much more extraordinary in storeâ€”for both of us. The Universe: Every moment in our lives has brought us to this single moment. A million futures lie before us. Which one will come true? *** "Beautifully crafted."--People Magazine "A book that is very much about the many factors that affect falling in love, as much as it is about the very act itself . . . fans of Yoonâ€™s first novel, Everything Everything, will find much to loveâ€”if not, moreâ€”in what is easily an even stronger follow up." â€”Entertainment Weekly "Transcends the limits of YA as a human story about falling in love and seeking out our futures." â€”POPSUGAR.com
