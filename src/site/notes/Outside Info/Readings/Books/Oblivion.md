> > Oblivion is a heartbreaking, exquisitely written memorial to the author's father, HÃ©ctor Abad GÃ³mez, whose criticism of the Colombian regime led to his murder by paramilitaries in 1987. Twenty years in the writing, it paints an unforgettable picture of a man who followed his conscience and paid for it with his life during one of the darkest periods in Latin America's recent history.
