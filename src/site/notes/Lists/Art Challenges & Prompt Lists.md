# Art Challenges & Prompt Lists

I'm new here, but from lurking this past month, I've noticed many posts asking about motivation and making time for art. Art challenges, prompt lists, and "draw this in your style" (DTIYS) challenges motivate me because they're interesting and provide external motivation (deadlines) that encourage me to post on a somewhat regular schedule.

I'll list some of my favourite art challenges and prompt lists that I've found, specifically on Instagram:

• @/Aprilcolors (daily prompts throughout April that focus on colour; hosted by @/faunwood on Insta)

• DTIYS (search # dtiys, # drawthisinyourstyle, # drawthisinyourstylechallenge, # dtiyschallenge)

• @/Floralsyourway (monthly prompt lists with daily flower-related prompts)

• @/Inktober (daily prompts throughout October; note that there are many alternative prompt lists)

• # Inktober52 (new challenge hosted by Inktober; weekly prompts throughout the year on Thursdays)

• Mermay (various mermaid-themed prompts throughout May)

• @/Stillherestilllife (weekly photo prompts that you recreate in your style; new prompts on Sundays)
